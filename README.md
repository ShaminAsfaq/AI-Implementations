# AI-Implementations

"AI Basic Implementations" contains a console application that takes in a value for N and tries to solve the infamous N-Queen problem. There's 2 files within this project.

One: This one uses the Hill Climbing Algorithm to solve the N-Queen problem.

Two: This one uses a rather simpler technique, recursion, to solve the same problem.


***********************


"N Queen GUI" contains a chunk of codes where the application solves the N-Queen problem with the Hill Climbing Algorithm (Random Restart variant) AND shows it on the Graphical User Interface that is implemented with Scene Builder.
